ABM Simulated Datasets
====================
Ole & Will at Midway,  2017-11-06 lunch

Generate Regions
-----------------

* *J* jobs w/ distributions for
    * wage *w*
        * mean
        * spread
* *P* people

Functions
-----------------

* probability of fired
    * .001 *log*(`tenure_in_weeks`)
    * rolled for each occupied job, each week

* probability of switching (*i.e.*, voluntarily leaving job)
    * fx of job * people ==> offers that outputs more desirable job for employee/agent
    * compare best offer to current job on
        * wage ratio
        * tenure?
        * risk averse

Early Simulation
-----------------
* model only:
    * one region (no immigration or emigration)
    * one employment sector (*e.g.*, restaurants)
* *P* people w/ distributions of
    * `employed` (binary)
    * `risk_averseness`
        * in the future, different sectors will have different risk profiles (*e.g.*, riskier in Africa & restaurant b/c less to lose)
* *J* jobs w/ distributions of
    * job security (expressed as a probability)

Schema of Simulated dataset
-----------------

* `tbl_person`
    * `risk_averseness`: fixed outcome over time (for the first version of the simulation)
* `tbl_job`
    * `wage`: fixed across tenures
* `tbl_week`
    * `week_id`
    * `month`
    * `season`
